                    Terms and Conditions: Website Bot Communication via WhatsApp
                    
                    Welcome to our website bot communication service. By accessing and using this service, you agree to comply with the following terms and conditions.
                    Please read them carefully before engaging in any conversations with the bots. If you do not agree with these terms, please refrain from using this
                     service.
                    
                    Purpose and Nature of the Service:
                    1.1 The website provides an interactive chatbot service accessible through WhatsApp, allowing users to engage in conversations with various bots
                     featuring different personalities.
                    1.2 The chatbot service is designed to provide information, assistance, and entertainment. However, it is important to note that the responses 
                    from the bots are generated using artificial intelligence and may not always reflect accurate, up-to-date, or comprehensive information.
                    1.3 The bots are programmed to simulate conversation with users and do not represent real individuals or provide human-like responses.
                    
                    User Responsibilities:
                    2.1 Users must be at least 18 years old or have reached the age of majority in their jurisdiction to use this service. By using the service, users 
                    confirm that they meet this requirement.
                    2.2 Users are solely responsible for the content of their conversations with the bots. You agree not to engage in any activity that violates 
                    applicable laws, regulations, or the rights of others.
                    2.3 Users should exercise caution and not disclose any personal, sensitive, or confidential information while conversing with the bots.
                     The website and its operators are not liable for any misuse or unauthorized disclosure of such information.
                    
                    Limitations and Risks:
                    3.1 While efforts are made to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the bot responses, the website and its operators do not guarantee the 
                    completeness, correctness, or suitability of the information provided.
                    3.2 The bots may sometimes provide general information or opinions and should not be considered as professional advice. Users should seek
                     independent professional advice for specific queries or concerns.
                    3.3 The website and its operators do not assume responsibility for any actions, decisions, or consequences resulting from user interactions 
                    with the bots.
                    3.4 The website and its operators do not guarantee uninterrupted access to the service, as it may be subject to technical issues, 
                    maintenance, or other factors beyond their control.
                    
                    Intellectual Property:
                    4.1 All intellectual property rights, including copyrights, trademarks, and any other proprietary rights related to the bots and the service, 
                    belong to the website and its operators.
                    4.2 Users may not reproduce, modify, distribute, or exploit any part of the service or its content without explicit permission from the website
                     and its operators.
                    
                    Privacy and Data Collection:
                    5.1 The website and its operators may collect and store user data for the purpose of improving the service and user experience. Please refer 
                    to our separate Privacy Policy for detailed information on data collection, usage, and protection.
